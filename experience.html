            <p class = "experience-text"> I returned to TIAA during the summer of 2018 to work as an Advanced Analytics Intern. </p>
            <p class = "experience-text"> My main project throughout the summer revolved around researching how changes in the market affect customer sentiment and actions. I looked at VIX historical data and proprietary data measuring customer outflows and complaints. I segmented the data by different time periods and products, and conducted regression analyses to determine the strengths of any possible relationships.</p>

            <h3 class = "h3-experience"> Teaching Assistant for CIS 121 &amp; CIS 320 </h3>
            <p class = "experience-text"> I TA'ed CIS 121 (Data Structures &amp; Algorithms) during the Spring 2018 semester and will be TA'ing CIS 320 (Algorithms) during the Fall 2018 semester. CIS 121 covers implementing algorithms and data structures including sorting, trees, graphs, hash tables and greedy algorithms, whereas CIS 320 is theoretical and covers topics such as universal hashing, dynamic programming, flow networks, complexity classes (P, NP, NP-Complete), and approximation algorithms. </p>
            <p class = "experience-text"> I taught approximately 20 students in weekly recitations covering class material. I held weekly office hours during which I would assist students with homework and understanding material, as well as debug students' programming assignments. I also graded written homework and exams for correctness and assessed programming assignments for style and efficiency. </p>

            <p class = "experience-text">  I interned at TIAA during the summer of 2017 in a Data Analyst role.</p>
            <p class = "experience-text"> My internship was spent developing a statistical model to predict the likelihood of acquiring potential customers based on their contact information. I conducted research on different demographics and their movement patterns and devised an appropriate model that would fit someone based on his or her own background. This project taught me how to construct a story from an otherwise numerical analysis, and culminated in me presenting my research and model to my entire team.</p>

            <p class = "experience-text"> During my freshman year I served as a Business Associate for PennScience, Penn's premier undergraduate science research journal. I was responsible for developing a corporate sponsorship package that delineated different levels of sponsorship, and then contacting and negotiating with local businesses regarding possible sponsorships.
